this header file contains the implementation of an AVL rank tree.

the tree is implemented using a template class, so it can be used with any type of data.

the speciality of this tree is the fact that the nodes location in memory is not changing,
thus it is possible to save pointers to nodes and use them later, without the need to find the node again.

all of the trees i found online, dont allow this, so i decided to implement my own, and upload it to github.
i hope it will be useful for you.
